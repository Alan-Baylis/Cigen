potential roads are not being checked for validity before being placed
building a road between intersection needs to take into consideration metric constraints so that it can alter the path a road takes to get from A to B. Maybe a new data type that holds an array of connected roads and intersections with a defined flow between them. Then the parent and child of the first and last ones could be exposed and just placed in the world that way.
make intersections as of now only 4 roads, one on each face.
minimum road length not enforced for metric
